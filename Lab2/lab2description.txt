**Part 1** 

Attempt these 3 problems. You may use any programming language. You may also use 

1. Pick 2 columns from a csv file, and sort the answers. 
    - Example: Get a unique list of Artist names and count average listens per song for a single week. Data available from SpotifyChart.com
2. Math calculations. 
    - Example: Convert the weather forecast for a week (a sequence of numbers) from Fahrenheit to Celsius and back
3. Make a request to any API endpoint and return its contents.
    - Example: [NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)](https://api.nasa.gov/#apod)

**Part** **2** 

Reflection over the exercises. 

- Which programming languages did you use for each of these problems?
- Why did you choose a particular language? (There is no right or wrong answer here, choosing an implementation is an art form)
- Was there any difficult or easy about using that language for solving the problem?
- If you had to solve the problem again, would you choose a different language?

I create three different java file for three question in part 1 of lab 2.
Part 2 of the lab is on a txt file in the same folder.
The example of output for three java file are also in the txt file in the folder.
